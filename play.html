            <h3>SCENE I.
                A room in LEONTES' palace.</h3>

            <p>Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies</p>
           <h6>HERMIONE</h6> 
            <p>Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
            'Tis past enduring.</p>
            <h6>First Lady</h6>
            <p>Come, my gracious lord,
            Shall I be your playfellow?</p>
            <h6>MAMILLIUS</h6>
            <p>No, I'll none of you.</p>
            <h6>First Lady</h6>
           <p> Why, my sweet lord?</p>
            <h6>MAMILLIUS</h6>
            <p>You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
            I were a baby still. I love you better.</p>
            <h6>Second Lady</h6>
           <p> And why so, my lord?</p>
            <h6>MAMILLIUS</h6>
            <p>Not for because
            Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
            become some women best, so that there be not
            Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
            Or a half-moon made with a pen.</p>
            <h6>Second Lady</h6>
            <p>Who taught you this?</p>
            <h6>MAMILLIUS</h6>
            <p>I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
            What colour are your eyebrows?</p>
