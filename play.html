            SCENE I.
             A room in LEONTES' palace.
            Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies
           <h6>HERMIONE</h6> 
            Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
            'Tis past enduring.
            <h6>First Lady</h6>
            Come, my gracious lord,
            Shall I be your playfellow?
            MAMILLIUS
            No, I'll none of you.
            <h6>First Lady</h6>
            Why, my sweet lord?
            <h6>MAMILLIUS</h6>
            You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
            I were a baby still. I love you better.
            <h6>Second Lady</h6>
            And why so, my lord?
            <h6>MAMILLIUS</h6>
            Not for because
            Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
            Become some women best, so that there be not
            Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
            Or a half-moon made with a pen.
            <h6>Second Lady</h6>
            Who taught you this?
            <h6>MAMILLIUS</h6>
            I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
            What colour are your eyebrows?
